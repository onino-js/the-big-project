My very good news is spreading away
I feel so ashamed to come on Sunday
Forgive me my Love it's so fun to betray
Your logic is fine, not the only way
starb you in the back how I like to play
Your domination ends in an ashtray
Now take me to church it will be okay
Don't worry we won't allow any decay
In your mighty eye I'm planting my ray
Black and white makes 50 shade of grey
You should have noticed how much I'm gay
