      <h3>CAN YOU?</h3>
      Can you look beyond the things you see?
      <br />
      Through the eyes not with the eyes?
      <br />
      Can you glimpse the person you can be?
      <br />
      And grasp the truth beyond the lies?
      <br />
      <br />
      Can you leave the past and embrace the now?
      <br />
      Taking charge of your space and time?
      <br />
      Can you move ahead and take a vow
      <br />
      To let go and make the climb?
      <br />
      <br />
      Can you accept yourself the way you are?
      <br />
      Align yourself with the universe.
      <br />
      Can you see your beauty from afar?
      <br />
      With paint and brush, you create your verse.
      <br />
      <br />
      Can you rise above sensations and emotions?
      <br />
      Be detached yet still attached?
      <br />
      Can you be wild yet calm like the oceans?
      <br />
      Respond to life and become unmatched.
      <br />
      <br />
      I can be. Yes, I can be.
      <br />
      I can rise beyond my past and live.
      <br />
      I can be. Yes, I can be.
      <br />
      I can be whatever I believe.
