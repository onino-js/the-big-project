      <h3>The strengh in unity</h3>
      When darkness comes, <br />
      warriors are born
      <br />
      In the Advent of war, <br />
      a new light shines.
      <br />
      There are those who will stand. <br />
      For they have sworn.
      <br />
      To defend the weak against <br />
      those who cross the lines.
      <br />
      <br />
      When darkness seems <br />
      to have won.
      <br />
      An alliance is formed
      <br />
      To stand as one.
      <br />
      For when strength fails
      <br />
      Unity prevails.
      <br />
      From an unexpected twist
      <br />
      A new tale.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now, when the battle is won.
      <br />
      And evil is forgiven.
      <br />
      Recognizing the power <br />
      Of evil's might.
      <br />
      For love must prevail
      <br />
      Another chance is given
      <br />
      But we'll never forget.
      <br />
      Darkness isn't light.
      <br />
