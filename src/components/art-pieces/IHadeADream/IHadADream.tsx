      <h3>I HAD A DREAM</h3>
      A dream is our soul's voice from within.
      <br />
      A silent whisper of our deepest thoughts. <br />
      In the silence of my long and heavy breaths.
      <br />
      I had a dream ,a stroll into my future's home. <br />
      <br />
      Awoken from the most beautiful dream. <br />
      A new light, shining from within. <br />
      So bright, they could hardly see. <br />
      The new me, determined to win. <br />
      <br />
      Oh! I have climbed this valley for too long. <br />
      Like an endless maze, turning in circles. <br />
      I press and push, from dusk till dawn;
      <br />
      but the chains of my mind hold me down. <br />
      <br />
      They laugh aloud and make fun of me, <br />
      They jeer at me and make poor jokes. <br />
      I smile and march on, they are just but a chapter in my book. <br />
      Soon, their words will be a step too distant.
      <br />
      <br />
      Life is a mirror, a reflection of your thoughts, <br />
      and fear is the stone, set for a mighty crash. <br />
      Break away through courage and will.
      <br />
      Mix all the colors, you are your life's own artist. <br />
      <br />
      I took the dare, I threw my coin. <br />
      With faith and hope, I still march on. <br />
      And whoever asked, I simply say, <br />
      I had a dream, a stroll into my future's home. <br />
      <br />
