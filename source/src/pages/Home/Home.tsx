        <p>
          We are a collision of artists who stroke the beat inadvertetly and
          contracted a rare melody. <br />
          Enjoy ! denouce and debounce ! <br />
          Certainly balls allways roll down from top to bottom. <br />
          The trust is one thing and the others are rather's layers king. In any
          kind of logic you'll find piece of peaces and facilities. What we have
          is precious. We have, we'll always have what it takes and makes to
          find them all.
          <br />
          Feel them and live it once for all.

          one tortoise is enough <br />
          Baby you got it wrong <br />
          please turn your soul into folks
        </p>
        <p>
          We are collusion, melody contracted <br />
          The mind of young boy far a west
        </p>
        <p>
          We are fusion, melody repeated… <br />
          CleO has fever, and we turn in his head
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a union, melody weighted ! <br />
          Devs heads and the songs of sirens
        </p>
        <p>
          We are completion, melody blended <br />
          By the nil being highlighted
        </p>
        <p>
          "Four living pillars that often lie."
          <br />
          "On top of the Tortoise galactic ride."

          "Holy bath in the dessert you may find"

        <p>
          Witch is conspiration, melody hacked
          <br />
          Might us know everything. Solution for the rest
        </p>
        <p>
          We are misconception, you are the problem <br />
          Simple melody, that digs in our heads
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s break this chain, make it an dote <br />I beg you join we in the
          Barbapapote
        </p>
        <p>We just melody and only you only got</p>
        <p>
          May you find your tortoise and go through the extreme
          <br />
          God will your sacrifice it might be rewarded <br />
          <br />
          Just for the livings and living for the justs <br />
          prettiest of the meme to misleading emblem <br />
