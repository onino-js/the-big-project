      <h3>HELLO NATURE</h3>
      Hello, Nature. Can I tell them? Can I whisper to their ears? <br />
      All your words echoed in silence that they seldom even hear.
      <br />
      You're the beauty that surrounds us, you're the greatest piece of art.
      <br />
      In your leaves are hidden mysteries, long before we had a start.
      <br />
      How beautiful you are, when oceans dance under the waves.
      <br />
      Oh! How majestic you are, when the mountains tell your tales.
      <br />
      <br />
      Hello, Nature. Can I tell them? Can I sing your praise all day?
      <br />
      Till the stars blanket the night and the skies are patched with gray.
      <br />
      Till the lions give their roar and their cubs run to the call.
      <br />
      Till my yonder is all gone and my heart cannot recall.
      <br />
      And even though we always hurt you, you forgive and always give.
      <br />
      You're the calmness that we breathe and without you, can we live
      <br />
      <br />
