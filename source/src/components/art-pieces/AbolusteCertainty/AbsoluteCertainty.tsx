      <h3>Absolute Certainty</h3>
      <p>
        I<br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie? <br />
        It cannot be found in promises of men <br />
        For words may turn to ashes in your mouth… <br />
        And foe may be the one you thought was friend… <br />
        The morality of man is changeable <br />
        As mutable and fickle as the wind… <br />
        The Master of Coin had two faces; <br />
        A virtuous mask disguised a heart of sin… <br />
        <br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie?
        <br />
        Ned Stark relied upon Petyr Baelish’s words
        <br />
        But at the crucial moment, his loyalty
        <br />
        Was as elusive as the eunuchs’ little birds… <br />
        <br />
        Absolute certainty lies not in words of men
        <br />
        Such faith is how Ned Stark met his end…
        <br />
        *<br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie?
        <br />
        When everything may not be as it seems…
        <br />
        Where men change their faces like allegiances <br />
        When reality appears stranger than in dreams… <br />
        <br />
        The Game of Thrones is a deadly battle
        <br />
        A chess match of power, intellect and brawn,
        <br />
        Pawns may appear as Kings and Queens,
        <br />
        And Kings and Queens may appear as pawns… <br />
        <br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie?
        <br />
        Greyjoy’s liberty was his captor in disguise… <br />
        When Ser Meryn beat the “broken brothel girl” <br />
        Arya Stark slit his throat and took his eyes… <br />
        Absolute certainty lies not in what you see <br />
        For veils of illusion obscure reality… <br />
        * <br />
        II <br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie? <br />
        In the beating heart beneath a mothers breast? <br />
        For a mother loves her children endlessly <br />
        And protects them as fiercely as a lioness… <br />
        <br />
        Cersei was a fortress for her children <br />
        Her body was their first sanctuary and home <br />
        But the price she’d pay to keep them safe <br />
        Was more than she ever could have known… <br />
        <br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie? <br />
        It lies within a mother’s daring iron will <br />
        To protect and love her last surviving child <br />
        No matter how many innocent she has to kill… <br />
        <br />
        Absolute certainty lies in a mother’s sacred bond <br />
        That extends across the Kingdom and beyond… <br />
        <br />
        *<br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie?
        <br />
        It cannot be found on the righteous path… <br />
        The High Sparrow walked in the light of Gods… <br />
        And there he met the Devil’s deadly wrath… <br />
        <br />
        Do not doubt the fierceness of a mother <br />
        Especially not of a Lannister Lioness <br />
        The lengths she goes to protect her cubs… <br />
        Is no match for the Sparrows’ piousness <br />
        <br />
        Where does absolute certainty lie? <br />
        For nowhere in the Seven Kingdoms can it be found <br />
        Except in a mother’s will to survive <br />
        Even if it means burning her own city to the ground… <br />
        <br />
        Absolute certainty lies not in the righteous course… <br />
        For evil and darkness may be the stronger force… <br />
        *<br />
        III
        <br />
        The High Sparrow may fly high…
        <br />
        But the Eagle Owl is the one that soars
        <br />
        It molts its feathers like a snake that sheds its skin…
        <br />
        Emerges like a Phoenix that transforms…
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The Eagle Owl is the one that transcends
        <br />
        Different places, realms and realities…
        <br />
        It comes at the night, fluttering its wings
        <br />
        And whispers softly to you in your dreams…
        <br />
        <br />
        It was a fate written in the winds of winter
        <br />
        That the High sparrow would eventually fall
        <br />
        For even though the Sparrow thought he won the battle
        <br />
        The Eagle Owl has the power to win the war
        <br />
        <br />
        A fateful darkness spreads across the land <br />
        Like a tide that casts itself against the sand…
        <br />
        <br />
        A lioness does not strike when prey is near…
        <br />
        She watches from the shadows patiently
        <br />
        And when she makes her swift attack
        <br />
        Her sharpened claws will cause fatalities…
        <br />
        <br />
        Her deadly act was almost mad as Aerys
        <br />
        The wild and vicious king who went insane
        <br />
        But if you imprison a lioness— fear her…
        <br />
        If she ever breaks free from her cage…
        <br />
        <br />
        Black smoke coalesces like dreams
        <br />
        Embers rise like a thousand vermillion prayers
        <br />
        The Sept of Baylor lies in destruction
        <br />
        The lives of the innocent were not be spared
        <br />
        And so the Eagle Owl takes it’s silent flight…
        <br />
        The only path is the way of the Seven’s light…
