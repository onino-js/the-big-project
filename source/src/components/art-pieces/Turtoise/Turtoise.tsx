        <p>
          All I need is one <br />
          One turtoise is enough <br />
          Baby you got it wrong <br />
          Please turn your soul into folks
        </p>
        <p>
          We are collusion, melody contracted <br />
          The mind of young boy far a west
        </p>
        <p>
          We are fusion, melody repeated… <br />
          CleO has fever, and we turn in his head
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a union, melody weighted ! <br />
          Devs heads and the songs of sirens
        </p>
        <p>
          We are completion, melody blended <br />
          By the nil being highlighted
        </p>
        <p>
          "Four living pillars that often lie."
          <br />
          "On top of the turtoise galactic ride."
          <br />
          "Holy bath in the dessert you may find"
        </p>
        <p>
          Witch is conspiration, melody hacked
          <br />
          Might us know everything. Solution for the rest
        </p>
        <p>
          We are misconception, you are the problem <br />
          Simple malady that digs in our heads
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s break this chain, make it an ax dote <br />I beg you join we in
          the Barbapapote
        </p>
        <p>We just melody and only you got</p>
        <p>
          May you find your turtoise and go through the extreme
          <br />
          God will your sacrifice it might be rewarded <br />
          <br />
          Just for the livings and living for the justs <br />
          Prettiest of the meme to misleading emblem <br />
          You will be good enough will be the Farce
        </p>
