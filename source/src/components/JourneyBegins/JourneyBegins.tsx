        We are a collision of artists who stroke the beat inadvertetly and
        contracted a rare melody. <br />
        Enjoy ! denouce and debounce ! <br />
        Certainly balls allways roll down from top to bottom. <br />
        The trusth is one thing and the others are rather's layers king. <br />
        In any kind of logic you'll find piece of peaches and facilities. <br />

        Feel them and live it once for all.
