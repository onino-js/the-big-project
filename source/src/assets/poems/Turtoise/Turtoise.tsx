      <h3> once upon a tortoise </h3>
      <p>
        All I need is one <br />
        one tortoise is enough <br />
        Baby got it wrong please turn your soul into folks <br />
        We are collusion melody contracted <br />
        The mind of a young boy far away in the west <br />
        We are fusion melody repeated… ClEO has fever and we are in his head{" "}
        <br />
        We are a union melody weighted! <br />
        Again devs has heard the songs of the sirens <br />
        We are completion melody blended May the nil be warm and benevolent{" "}
        <br />
        Four living pillars that often lie. <br />
        On top of the Tortoise galactic ride May we find our holy bath in the
        dessert <br />
        We are conspiration melody hacked <br />
        Might we know everything. Rest for my solution <br />
        We are misconception and you are the problem <br />
        Simple melody that digs in our head <br />
        Let’s break this chain let’s make it an anecdote. <br />
        May you find your tortoise and go to the extreme <br />
        Your god will be reward by your self-sacrifice <br />
        Just for living the prettiest of the meme. <br />
        You’'ll be good enough enough will be the Farce <br />
