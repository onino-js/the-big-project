      <h3>once upon a tortoise</h3>
      <p>
        All I need is one <br />
        one tortoise is enough <br />
        Baby you got it wrong <br />
        please turn your soul into folks
      </p>
      <p>
        We are collusion, melody contracted <br />
        The mind of young boy far a west
      </p>
      <p>
        We are fusion, melody repeated… <br />
        CleO has fever, and we turn in his head
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a union, melody weighted ! <br />
        Devs heads and the songs of sirens
      </p>
      <p>
        We are completion, melody blended <br />
        By the nil being highlighted
      </p>
      <p>
        "Four living pillars that often lie."
        <br />
        "On top of the Tortoise galactic ride."
        <br />
        "Holy bath in the dessert you may find"
      </p>
      <p>
        Witch is conspiration, melody hacked
        <br />
        Might us know everything. Solution for the rest
      </p>
      <p>
        We are misconception, you are the problem <br />
        Simple melody, that digs in our heads
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s break this chain, make it an dote <br />I beg you join we in the
        Barbapapote
      </p>
      <p>We just melody and only you only got</p>
      <p>
        May you find your tortoise and go through the extreme
        <br />
        God will your sacrifice it might be rewarded <br />
        <br />
        Just for the livings and living for the justs <br />
        prettiest of the meme to misleading emblem <br />
        It will be good enough will be the Farce
      </p>
