once upon a tortoise
All I need is one one tortoise is enough
Baby got it wrong please turn your soul into folks
We are collusion melody contracted
The mind of a young boy far away in the west
We are fusion melody repeated… ClEO has fever and we are in his head
We are a union melody weighted!
Again devs has heard the songs of the sirens
We are completion melody blended May the nil be warm and benevolent
Four living pillars that often lie.
On top of the Tortoise galactic ride
May we find our holy bath in the dessert 
We are conspiration melody hacked
Might we know everything. Rest for my solution
We are misconception and you are the problem
Simple melody that digs in our head
Let’s break this chain let’s make it an anecdote.
May you find your tortoise and go to the extreme
Your god will be reward by your self-sacrifice
Just for living the prettiest of the meme.
You’'ll be good enough enough will be the Farce
